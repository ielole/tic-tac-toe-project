#Project built with:

  *HTML
  *SCSS and CSS
  *jQuery
  *Utilized: an API and Rails

<!-- Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy. -->

My inital plan was to work through the project by coding each step that a player would take as they navigated through signing up, signing in, playing a game, viewing their statistics and then signing out, but my actual coding process involved a lot of jumping around to different aspects of the project.  When I got stuck on some part that I was working on, I would start working on another piece of the project. I found working with other developers who were attempting to tackle the same aspect of the project that I was, the most helpful approach if I got stuck on a small problem. If I really got stuck, asking to talk something through with the consultants helped me to flesh out what I really needed to do.


<!-- List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations. -->
#Changes to be made in future:

#User stories:
    * As a player, I want to be able to compete against other people during games.
    * As a player, I want to have my record of wins and losses saved, so I can view them when I am signed in.
    * As a player, I want to have a unique account that only I can access and edit.
    * As a player, I want to be informed about game play throughout each game.
